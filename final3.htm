<h1 style="text-align:center;"> A Worldwide Threat: Act Now!</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px"> Ocean acidification is present in all sorts of biomes and climates around the world today and is causing significant damage to the industry of countries irrespective of which area of the world 
they are in. One might consider the cases of India and The Arctic, two countries with climates which could not be more different from each other, but are both experiencing an ongoing struggle against ocean acidification.The Arctic is naturally susceptible to ocean acidification due to its lower temperatures causing a higher absorption rate of carbon dioxide. Additionally, acidification in the Arctic is exacerbated by anthropogenic activities. The melting of ice sheets due to global warming lowers the concentration of dissolved salts that slow down ocean acidification, the rate of acidification further.
By contrast, the Indian subcontinent, being close to the Equator, has a tropical climate with temperatures much higher than the Arctic. This factor would automatically mean that the water surrounding the country absorbs far less carbon dioxide. However, the Indian coasts have also become victims of ocean acidification. How? Human action. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased in the area due to growing industries and other anthropogenic activities. This increased concentration of carbon dioxide has been absorbed by the Bay of Bengal and caused harm.

<p style="font-size:20px"> Ironically, humans are also impacted by these changes. 400 million reside in the catchment area of the Bay. 
Its marine resources provide livelihood for many, including over 200 million fishermen, a majority of whom are from India. Since 2000, 
the value of the catch per year in India is estimated at over a billion US dollars. This yield can be greatly harmed by acidification 
which can cause loss of marine biodiversity and population density in the area and thus, lead to lower income or loss of livelihood for many.
 
Meanwhile, around a tenth of worldwide commercial catches are provided by fisheries in The Arctic. More southerly species have been observed 
entering the waters due to increased temperatures. However, fish populations are predicted to decline in the area owing to acidification to 
which they cannot adapt. This is sure to impact the global food supply and subsistence fishing of the indigenous people of the Arctic.

<p style="font-size:20px">Another area these countries will suffer in is tourism. Degradation of the landscape as a result of acidification will 
cause a decline in tourism, which accounts for 15% of national GDP of coastal regions along the Bay of Bengal. 
The Sundarbans, a tourist attraction, has fallen victim to acidification, which has resulted in a loss of its biodiversity,
and thus, decreased its appeal to visitors. Tourism is an important industry in India, accounting for nearly 10% of its GDP 
and 8.1% of total employment. A decline can cause significant damage including job losses. </p>
<p style="font-size:20px"> As for the Arctic, ecotourism is a relatively recent development, but still an important consideration with regard to the economy of the eight countries that comprise the region. Ocean acidification will undoubtedly affect the biodiversity of the Arctic, affecting the seasonal timing and productivity of fish species and also affecting marine mammals and seabirds â€“ all important features of marine ecotourism. Therefore, a decrease in the populations of these notable and iconic Arctic species could have negative consequences for the future of the growing industry of marine ecotourism in the region. Still, there is a considerable difference between the importance of the tourism industry in India in comparison with the Arctic, demonstrating how there can be other factors which influence the significance of the ocean acidification threat.
</p>
<p style="font-size:20px">In essence, while there are climate-based differences between biomes regarding the prevalence of ocean acidification, these do not necessarily determine the ability of a country to withstand acidification. Both India and the Arctic will experience the harsh economic and ecological consequences of acidification if control over anthropogenic activities and the resulting emissions is not increased. Thus, as our understanding of the realities of climate change grows, as does the importance of understanding ocean acidification as a worldwide threat.</p>
