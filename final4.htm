<p> <i> Continued from Page 1... </i> </p>
<p style="font-size:20px"> In this century defining year of 2020, where we are all chained to our houses, and manipulated by the daunting uncertainty that shadows our lives, we have finally found time in our hands, and gathered the courage to introspect, and reflect upon the philosophy by which we conduct lives. Yet, yesterday, or the day before, or the day before even that, or the week before and the month before, and in the last 3 months gone by, as you made a dozen phone calls for delivery of your groceries, or stood fretting about your unmanicured appearance before a mirror, or perhaps amused yourself on countless zoom calls, did you stop to think about those dolphins spotted in the Indian Ocean? Or did they give you but a fleeting excitement, that was so quickly forgotten by other supposedly more pressing matters? 
Trust, that in this darkness, good news has come.

<p style="font-size:20px"> While our activities have caused C0<sub>2</sub> concentrations to be increasing at an exponential rate ever since the Industrial revolution, 
The reduction in carbon emissions due to the economy on a standstill, industrial processes on standby, and lack of transportation, has reduced the emissions in India by 30% and 15% in April and May respectively. 
The graph alongside demostrates a very important concept: Anything in excess is a poison.

While the green-house effect is a natural phenomenon, it is this enhanced effect that we have created, which creates a warming that is damaging to life on land and in the oceans.

<p style="font-size:20px"> World-altering events like the Spanish flu, or Second world war, have caused carbon levels to drop annually; but the fall in C0<sub>2</sub> levels attributed to COVID-19 this time, has exceeded those that mark even those radical events. 

In the given chart, the blue bars display the largest falls in C0<sub>2</sub> ever recorded.

The grey bar represents possible drops in carbon dioxide levels in 2020 as compared to in 2019.

The red bar represents the effects of COVID-19 on the labelled sectors.

<p style="font-size:20px"> While the statistics point to the beneficial environmental changes that have resulted from the pandemic, we must remember that these values have been calculated based on what would have been the case if there were no obstacles, that is if we continued to produce emissions in an exponential and unthinking way. It must therefore not be confused for the misconception that climate change has been resolved.

 </p>
<p style="font-size:20px"> While less air congestion may reduce the emissions by 895 million tons, putting things in perspective, that accounts for just 2% of our total carbon release. 
While the benefits of this lockdown have caused CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to drop by 17%, this environmental milestone will be but a fossil of the past, if we do not make the attempt to maintain these reduced levels. In fact, in the next decade, global emissions must reduce by 7.6% every year so that we do not see an increase in temperature by more than 1.5 degrees.

<p style="font-size:20px"> What these statistics exactly imply is a matter of much debate, but what is evident is that while the damages our done, our efforts now must be focused on preventing the climatic crisis from amplifying; And we have gotten the necessary push, and motivation to in small steps realign our lives, industries and the economy towards cleaner energy. In treading this path of sustainability, while we may not benefit from the immediate implications of our change, we must trust that the future will hold bright things for humanity, and what lies beneath the surface.

Then we can tell great stories, about how our momentary slip in judgement put coral reefs at risk, but that with our spirit and will to quickly rectify, the coral reefs were awakened from that slumber, and reborn with a burst of color and life, that shone brighter than it ever did before.
